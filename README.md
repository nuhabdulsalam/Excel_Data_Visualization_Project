# 📊 Excel Data Visualization Project – Sales Insights  
My first Excel data visualization project, where I analyzed a sales dataset using Excel functions and charts to extract insights.

## 🔍 Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to practice Excel functions and chart creation while uncovering meaningful sales insights.  
I used formulas like:  
- *SUMIF / COUNTIF* for aggregation  
- *Charts (Pie, Column, Bar)* for visualization
  
## 📈 Visualizations & Insights  
1. *Sales by Region*  
   - East leads with *7,690* in sales.  
   - Central has the lowest performance.  

2. *Orders by Segment*  
   - Majority of orders come from *Consumers*.  

3. *Sales by Product Category*  
   - *Technology* drives the highest revenue.
